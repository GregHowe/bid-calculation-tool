# üßæ Bid Calculation Tool ‚Äì Backend

This is the backend component of the **Bid Calculation Tool**, a full-stack web application designed to calculate the total cost of a vehicle at auction. It dynamically computes all applicable fees based on the vehicle's price and type (Common or Luxury).

---

## üß± Architecture Overview

The backend is built using **ASP.NET Core Web API**, following clean architecture principles and object-oriented design. Fee calculations are encapsulated in dedicated services for clarity, scalability, and testability.

### üîß Fee Calculators

- `BasicFeeCalculator`
- `SpecialFeeCalculator`
- `AssociationFeeCalculator`
- `StorageFeeCalculator`

These are injected into the main `FeeCalculatorService`, which orchestrates the full fee computation.

## üìä Fee Calculation Logic

The total cost includes:

| Fee Type           | Common Vehicle                     | Luxury Vehicle                     |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Basic Buyer Fee    | 10% of price (min $10, max $50)     | 10% of price (min $25, max $200)    |
| Special Seller Fee | 2% of price                         | 4% of price                         |
| Association Fee    | Based on price range:               | Same as Common                      |
|                    | $1‚Äì$500 ‚Üí $5                        |                                     |
|                    | $501‚Äì$1000 ‚Üí $10                    |                                     |
|                    | $1001‚Äì$3000 ‚Üí $15                   |                                     |
|                    | Over $3000 ‚Üí $20                    |                                     |
| Storage Fee        | Fixed $100                          | Fixed $100                          |

```

The API will be available at: 
http://localhost:5000/api/fees/calculate

## üì¨ API Endpoint

POST `/api/fees/calculate`

Request:

```json
{
  "price": 1000,
  "type": "Common"
}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "basicFee": 50,
  "specialFee": 20,
  "associationFee": 10,
  "storageFee": 100,
  "total": 1180
}
```

üß™ Running Unit Tests
```bash
cd backend/BidCalculator.Tests
dotnet test
```

## Test Coverage

    ‚úÖ FeeCalculatorService integration tests

    ‚úÖ Individual fee calculators

    ‚úÖ Edge cases (min/max fees, price thresholds)
