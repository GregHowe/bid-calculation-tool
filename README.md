# üöó Bid Calculation Tool ‚Äî Full Stack App

This is a full-stack web application that allows users to calculate the total cost of a vehicle at auction. It dynamically computes all applicable fees based on the vehicle's price and type (Common or Luxury), using a backend API and a responsive frontend interface.

## üß± Architecture Overview

The project is divided into two main components:

- **Frontend**: Built with Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite
